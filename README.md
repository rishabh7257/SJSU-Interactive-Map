# SJSU-Interactive-Map
The ios application allows student to track the distance from their current location to any building in SJSU campus map.

For this application I have used google maps api to calculate the distance from current location to the point on map

#Features included
1. Google Distance calculation which involves registering application on the google maps and using their API's.
2. Ploting the actual location (latuitude and longitude) on static map which include calculating the maps cordinates and rotating the actual map to get the point on static image map of SJSU campus.
3. You can zoom in and zoom out.
4. Make the zoom persistent so that when you quit the application, next time you open it you will get the map / image in last zoomed state.
5. Implemented the search functionality by using table view controller.
6. Made use of cocoa pods to install external dependencies.
